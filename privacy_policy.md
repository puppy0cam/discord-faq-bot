# Privacy Policy

The use of the application ("Bot") in a server only requires the collection of user data of users who have permission to modify the permanent state of the Bot within the server.
The data collected includes, but is not limited to Discord user ID values, Discord server ID values, and the specific questions/answers specified by users authorised by the server to create responses.

## Access to data

Access to data is only permitted to the Bot's developers, and only in the scope required for the development, testing, and implementation of features for the Bot.
Bot data is not sold, provided to, or shared with any third party, except where required by law or by a Terms of Service agreement.

## Storage of data

Data is stored within a Cloudflare Workers Key/Value database. No guarantee is provided towards the data security, and the owners assume no liability for the unintentional or malicious breach of data. In the event of an unauthorised Data access, users will be notified upon their next usage of the application within the server.

## Underage Users

The use of the Bot is not permitted for minors under the age of 13, or under the age of legal consent for their country. This is in compliance with the [Discord Terms of Service](https://discord.com/terms). No information will be knowingly stored from an underage user. If it is found out that a user is underage we will take all necessary action to delete the stored data.

## Questions

If you have any questions or are concerned about what data might be being stored contact `@puppy0cam`. For more information check the [Discord Terms of Service](https://discord.com/terms)

## Retention of Data

Data that has not been explicitly requested to be deleted will remain stored indefinitely, as there is no mechanism that would allow the Bot to detect when the application has been removed from a Discord server.
